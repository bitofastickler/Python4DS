  Have had this for one day and the cover is already coming off. Nothing a little glue won’t fix, and that’s the downside of paperbacks that you have to put weight on to keep closed, in my opinion.BUT the inner content is well worth it. I’ve been wanting to learn programming for years but have often gone away discouraged because the tutorials and teachers randomly start throwing complicated problems at you out of nowhere.Not so with this book. It eases you into each topic, breaks it down very clearly, and has exercises throughout that you can follow along with. Make sure you follow along! There are specific exercises throughout, but I highly recommend typing out the example code and playing around with it/experimenting on your own as well. Then by the time you get to the exercises you’ll have a good idea about how to approach it.STICK WITH IT! I decided I wanted to learn to program 10 years ago! I would start for a week and then quit when it got too complicated and felt overwhelming. Then I’d come back to it a few years later, and same thing. Then it hit me one day, “If I had pushed through the first time and been patient, I’d have 10 years of experience as a programmer right now. Do I want to look back in another 10 years and feel that way again? Or do I want to push through this time so in 10 years I’ll actually have the experience under my belt!?”Easy answer!Stick with it. Be patient with yourself if things get too complicated or you “feel too dumb” to get it. If you hit a block, go back a few pages and go through it again. Everyone is selling “learn ____ quick!” books these days. It’s a good way to get random chunks of knowledge but a terrible way to master it. So be patient!And get this book. :). It makes things very simple to understand and really holds your hand through everything.

  Just finished the book and followed the code all way, even did some of the ""Try this yourself"" exercises.  Very well organized.  6 stars on that.  Code in the book was accurate and worked as expected.  I didn't just try the code from the resource web site.  I actually typed in every line from the book and made it all the way to deployment.  (Quite an accomplishment, I say. :-)).Only one gripe - see pictures attached.  After 3 weeks of ownership, the book lost its clothing.  :-(I wonder if Mr Matthes will send me an autographed copy to replace my sad, broken, copy?  :-)

  What is good about it? It teaches you the basics of Python But it does not have any advanced materials inside.  Evey little example is well explained. It has a lot of examples are presented. It also asked readers to do exercises after concept.However, I wish it comes with an answer for those after chapter exercises. Otherwise, it becomes meaningless because you won't know if you got it or not. Overall, well explained but somewhat too much explanation. Thus, this might be good for people who do not have any programming skill. Also, words are simple and straightforward.Update: Thanks to the author reply, there are solutions online. But I still think it explained things too much. Thus, costed too much reading for a simple concept.

  Let me preface this review by saying that I have zero programming experience. I'm only four chapters into the book and I gotta say - Python is finally making sense to me! I've tried reading ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and I have no doubt that it's a good book. However, for me, it was not a good starting point and I found myself lost trying to read through the first few chapters - maybe I'll re-read ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" afterwards after I finish ""Python Crash Course"". I'll do a follow-up review of this book when I'm done, but that won't be for a while; I'm going at my own pace and ensuring that I understand each topic and lesson. This book is worth the money if you want to learn Python!

  The contents of the book are better than its manufactured quality.  Sadly, less than a week after receiving it, the cover came free of the rest of the book. It  was apparently only held on by two narrow strips of glue on the first and last pages, and no glue holding it to the actual spine!The book contents itself are pretty good, but it does stay fairly simple. I bought the book because of the format of the examples, with code, point by point descriptions of the code elements, and then the output.  Some of the examples don't go very deep. I was looking at loop iterations, and the book really only covered using them with a print statement, though I was hoping for how to set variables and perform calculations according to current list value.

  I write firmware/software professionally in C/C++/C#.  Recently I started learning Python and BASH.  Got this book to learn Python, the book was a bit long winded. If I was a newbie I'd want it to be wordy.If you're a pro trying to pick up Python as new language in your arsenal, you'll have to read through a lot of fluff that you'd learn in your intro the programming classes in college.  The information isn't wrong, and the examples work, but....man...it's a long read.  I believe the book could probably be cut in half if the author removed the fluff.Why the 3 stars?  Most books about learning have all the basics listed in a single chapter, so people with experience can just read it real quick and move on to the more complex ideas.  This book interweaves the basics through out the entire book, which for me was a mind boring read (IMHO).

  With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable.I have some programming experience, but it has been years since I coded, and then it was usually for relatively basic tasks in undergrad. I was looking for something that would not insult my intelligence, but that would still be interesting enough to keep me on task. So, after searching around I found this book. I saw the highly rated reviews. I skimmed the language that the author used in the sample. I read the table of contents and saw that the second part of the book consisted of creating games in order to solidify the skills learned.Yes! This sounded perfect.I have not been disappointed.The book walks the reader through setting up (checking if Python is on the computer already, downloading it if necessary, using an IDE and what that is, etc). And then it moves on to the usual basic programming. The writing is clear. I had no problems with the examples and found the practice problems to be well chosen. I also liked the way that the author encouraged good practices such as documentation and testing.I am currently in Part 2 of the book and have been working on the first project, a game called Alien Invasion which is basically a version of Space Invaders. I am definitely enjoying that. And I can see how some of the skills I learn from this could transfer over into monitoring my equipment. Reading files, taking user input, opening windows, drawing on the screen, making calculations, all of these things are necessary for the game, and for my own goals.I personally never had any problems, but I also noticed that the author's website includes cheat sheets, solutions, and errata, not to mention the files suggested for the projects.I am not sure if this book is for an absolute beginner. My experience is too far from that for me to be a good judge. But I can say that a person with basic programming knowledge and no prior knowledge of Python found it to be a great resource.

  This book does all it can to make programming formidable and boring. It's not concise. It's too wordy.Most of it is filled with explanations and vanilla examples that just is not very enlightening.It's first chapter ""getting started"" will make you never start.Reading the first chapter, I decided not to read any further. Then my friend came along and did all that was intended in the chapter in less than a minute. The book spends a whole chapter on what can be done in a minute. I'm sure it meant well, but it is excessively full of explanations that are not relevant, and stuff that will just make the beginners crap.(Do beginners really have to know anything about Python 2? Or the difference between Python 2 and 3? Seriously? If not, why did you put it on the very first chapter?)It just doesn't get any better in the later chapters.This is a passage from Chapter 2:""When an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does itsbest to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter providesa traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a recordof where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code.Here’s an example of the traceback that Python provides after you’ve accidentallymisspelled a variable’s name ...

  The index in this book is awful so one star is the best I can offer.  Wish I could give it zero stars.  I have programmed in other languages and aimed to learn about Python so as a volunteer I could answer students' questions in a junior-high programming course.  The index is horrible and newcomers will find it difficult to locate important information.  As an example, the use of a loop in software lets a computer do something many times.  The word ""loop"" is not in the index.  That goes for """"else"" and ""elif,"" also important commands.  The entry labeled ""for loops"" points readers to a chapter labeled ""Working with Lists.""  Granted, this chapter includes information about loops, but you need to go to Chapter 7, ""User Input and while loops.""  The topic of loops should have its own chapter.

Basically, I've taught myself by watching countless video, visiting numerous websites, purchasing lessons and books and hours of trial in error. When I decided to take on Python, I wanted to approach it differently and get a good understanding, so I decided to purchase a highly rated beginner's book. Python Crash Course was recommended on a programming website. I decided to purchase it and give it a go. The author of Python Crash Course, Eric Matthes, does a phenomenal job explaining the language and providing simplified examples. What I have found most beneficial is the break down and explanation of each step he provides after almost every example. Giving you the ""why's"" behind the process.

  First, I just want to say thank you for allowing multiple chapters in your free kindle preview! I get so frustrated when I go to buy a new score (music) book. Just this week I purchased a Halloween easy piano book. It only shows the cover and the index. Now one is going to steal any music if you show two or three pages of different scores. But, it lets me know if I've at the level to be able to play it. Which brings me to this book. I have many beginner Python books. I wanted to teach a friend python and couldn't really recommend a book. On Kindle, I saw this had a free preview. If it didn't I wouldn't have purchased this book. But, it had I think four free chapters. I read chapters two and three. And was hooked. Now...I am compltely paperless. I do everything by PDF. However, I'm a book person. I like having a physical book. I've tried e-books but it's just not the same. I ordered the paper book and while it was shipped I was able to keep reading thanks to the free preview.The book is awesome. If you have NO programming background at all. This book is definitely for you. And it's written to where you can understand it with real-world examples that are relatable. I have many of the De-Mystifying books from McGraw. What some of those authors were thinking...I have no idea. The real-world example they give are not relatable to a normal human.This book will get you quickly up-to-speed and programming in Python!

  This book didn't feel like a crash course but didn't feel like a textbook either. The author briskly reviewed some key basic concepts and gave the odd pointer here or there, and the book promptly moved on to some real-world examples. The author also gives you an overview of what is out there in the Python ecosystem, which is helpful because there is a lot out there. It is not like Java where everything you need is in the API. If you're like me and you had a background in programming already, that's exactly what you were looking for. If you are completely new to programming and you've decided to learn in Python, this would still be a good book to buy but you may want to buy another book to complement it.

  My background is in JS, so I was looking for something that would both help me navigate installing Python3, learning the language syntax and differences in rules, and delve a little deeper in classes & objects.So far, it's clear that this is set up for absolute beginners, and I wouldn't call it a ""crash"" course. It's extremely thorough about walking you through common syntax errors you'll probably make on your own. I do like that it encourages you to play with breaking the code, which is absolutely necessary for learning how to code, but it's a little hand-holdy. I was expecting the guidance to loosen up as you went on, but as of chapter 6 out of the 11 chapters that introduce the topics, it's still very sheltered.I'd suggest people wanting a little more challenge/for things to stick a little longer read the first ""A Simple ___"" section whenever a topic is introduced, then jump to the exercises. See what you can accomplish there just from seeing the example code, and if you run into trouble, then go back through all of the ""how to do this exact thing"" stuff.Using the book this way, it's been a great reference book, and a quick read. I wish more complex ideas were introduced earlier, like conditionals/loops, so that the exercises could introduce more problem-solving than you can get with just print earlier, but I'm looking forward to the projects section.Oh, and yeah the binding did pop off on day 1. But it was super clean, so I just dabbed some rubber cement on the spine. It's not a big deal.

  I am a beginner/intermediate Python programmer with many holes in my knowledge; thus I am using this book both for reference and for systematic self-teaching.I've never seen such a thorough, comprehensive, and easy to use table of contents and index in any technical book.  This makes the book as easy to use as a reference as it is a teaching tool through building projects.This author, who is a trained teacher, clearly has a rationale behind laying out every concept. It's no wonder it's been translated into several languages and is a best seller.The form factor, typeface, and spacing are also carefully planned, as each page draws the eye in.Another note of interest is that I, perhaps like many people, tend not to want to learn through building someone else's projects. I just want to learn what I need to build my own! Thus when I take online courses, I avoid those that are project based.  But a physical book can make it worthwhile to build the projects, because doing so makes it an even better reference afterward. That is, the projects become old friends rather than throw-away. I only thought of this now, looking at this book, because I am confident that if any teacher/author can make me build their project, this author can.As programmers, we all heavily use google to find answers. I am happy to now have a physical book at my side. And just to make this book even better, it comes with lots of free meta materials which the author is actively maintaining.  This book is a find.

  First off, I want to enter a quote from page 173: ""This brings you to an interesting point in your growth as a programmer.  When you wrestle with questions like these, you're thinking at a higher logical level rather than a syntax-focused level.  Your're thinking not about Python, but about how to represent the real world in code.""  This quote reminds me of another: ""the best programming is done by programmers immersed in the environment they are writing for.  I was lucky to be immersed and programming in a clinical environment.  I've been out of that (programming) environment for about eight years and grabbed this book because I'd been missing this kind of thinking.

  This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++.  Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role).Fast forward to now. I have one foot in each of 2 worlds - behavioral science and IT (networking and security). Both worlds use Python. I decided to get this book and finally sit down and learn it (I was briefly introduced to Python when I was an undergraduate and asked why we didn't have a class in it, I would have preferred it). This book has very clear, concrete examples and you learn by doing. For the first half (or a little more), you'll learn the basics of what you need to navigate the language. You'll do short exercises to lock in what you learn. Later on the book, you'll actually work on larger, more involved projects and the author guides you through with excellent explanations.Needless to say, I picked up Python faster than any language before it. I've come to really like the No Starch Press books as I find them (in general) to be well-written  and clear.

  The first 8 chapters are presented at a good pace with lots of exercises.  (Work the exercises).  Exercises are challenging the first time you see them.  Ch 9 (Classes) didn't stick the first time through, but maybe it's the material ??  I expect to have to repeat it several times.There is a BIG step up into chapter 12 -- the first large project -- Alien Invasion.  Found myself in a position of typing in the code, and understanding the code, but knowing I could not write the code.  What makes it especially difficult was -- to save space -- the author plugged snippets of code into partial program listings while telling you in the text to delete sections of code.  I would suggest that's a very poor way of changing the code as it's extremely easy for the user to mess up.  I got frustrated to the point of just quitting several times working through this portion of the book.  This cost it a star.Also, the code ran extremely slow -- taking half an hour to load.  Not sure what that's about.  Looked online but couldn't find anybody with a similar problem.  Like everybody else said -- the binding is awful -- but the content is really good.

  It took me some time to get around to learn Python scripting, but so far it is simple and straight forward in how to program in Python.  If you want to get in further depth, it would definitely be good to check out O'Reillys books for Python as they are more in depth technically(have not used it, but my coworker has told me so).Reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is due to the simplicity of the practice problems and wording.  I wish it was more challenging and utilizes the previous chapters we learned and continues to implement it in the current chapters, as an ongoing and repetitive learning.  If the author followed the practice problems ""C Programming Language"" by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian W. Kernighan(very good C programming book by the way), then it would definitely be more challenging and allow the person to think and be more creative.  The problems the author gives are okay, but I used them to think of more creative things.Definite good investment in having a physical copy, reading it and going through the book and examples.

  i have a very hard time with reading and comprehension. most text books or educational materials are super hard for me to read due to various disabilities. i have wanted to learn how to program for a very long time, but i was intimidated by most texts and felt discouraged that someone with these issues could never learn to programbut this book is amazing. its formatted well to be informative but accessible, it explains things well and the project-based learning is awesome. ive only spent a few days reading it but ive already learned so much, when it usually takes me weeks to get where i am with only half as much comprehension. you can tell the author knows how intimidating it looks to a lot of people who dont know the first thing about coding languages, because they have explained it in a way that i could grasp immediately.if youre looking to learn Python, i would recommend this book 100000%. i hope this author has other books on different programming languages, because if this is how they wrote Python, ill definitely read the others.10/10, amazing, im enjoying learning through this method so much. its not easy learning a language for the first time- but this books helps you work through the difficulties through small projects and encouraging readers to make errors to see what errors look like, and what fixes them

  This review is for the printed version of the book; I have not seen the kindle version.  I am an experienced developer, but brand new to Python.  After buying, and in one case returning, several kindle books on Python, I still hadn’t found one which I felt did a first-rate job of presenting the material.  Then I bought the “Python Crash Course” book.  I’m only on Page 130, but so far the book has exceeded my expectations.The layout is sensible and very professional, the examples are instructive, and the exercises are as much fun as you can have when trying to learn a new programming language.  As several others have noted, you might want to order a tube of glue when you buy this book; the cover started falling off after about Day 2.  I’m not going to knock off a star for a problem like that, but it is a bit annoying.  So, if you want to learn Python, I can highly recommend this book to get you started.

  This book is excellent for anyone who wants to learn a computer language from the ground up.  It walks you through the free software to install (how to install it and trouble shoot any issues you may have), gives plenty of examples and discusses common errors, and has made learning Python easy and fun.My background is NOT in computer science, but in mathematics.  I have very little experience programming.  I purchased this book because my 10 year old was interested in learning to program and I wanted to be able to help him get started.  I'm not sure if he would have the patience to read the book on his own, but any adult or kid over the age of 13 should be good to go.The quality of construction of the book cover is ""meh"".  It came undone after a few days of use, but the binding is good (nothing a little glue in the spine wont fix).  The paper and printing are of good quality.  I wouldn't let this minor issue deter me from recommending this book to others.The software for python doesn't need much to run.  In fact, there are apps out there for running it on phones or tablets.  You don't need a full fledged PC to use this software (and again it is free).Best of luck programming.  It is fun!

  I read this book after taking an introductory online course. The online course did a great job of helping me understand the core concepts of Python, but left out a lot of the conventions (such as formatting). This is where the book REALLY comes in handy. The author puts an emphasis on common formatting used within the industry.The examples and the exercises are extremely well thought out and really helped me understand the code. The examples are usually something you'd encounter in real-life and when the author expands the code for those examples its done so bit by bit so you get a full understanding of what is actually going on.First half of the book is all about learning python. The second half walks you through big projects, such as a video game, web page, or web application. I've done all the exercises and am currently working on the video game project.HIGHLY recommended for anyone trying to pick up Python.

  I am 8 chapters in and so far all my expectations have been exceeded. The book is very well organized and assumes the reader is starting from virtually zero programming experience. If you've got an analytical mind and love solving problems, you'll be okay. I have a lot of experience in Excel where some of the longer formulas indeed feel like mini-programs, so certain things in coding like variables, Boolean expressions (True/False) were already familiar.I would strongly recommend trying to work through the exercises on your own before peeking at the solutions on the website. I know it's tempting, and it may take 30, 45 minutes or more to figure it out, but when you do it's a marvelous feeling!I've read comments that the book is poor quality and comes apart at the spine, but so far that has not been my experience. Possibly it happens down the road but right now, after 3+ days with it opened on my desk, it's holding up fine.Big recommend!!UPDATE: Unsurprisingly, given how many others had the same problem, the spine of my book came apart this morning. It's an easy fix w/ some glue, but it's disappointing that the physical quality is this poor. No Starch needs to do better.

  This book is truly awesome. It teaches basic Python programming from the ground up. There's just the right amount of detail. I quickly became proficient at writing for loops, while loops, if-elif-else statements, and functions. The book is prefaced with nice explanations of the differences between lists, dictionaries, etc. I mostly loved the breakdowns of each example. The author gives a step-by-step explanation for each. This is clearer and more accessible than any other book I've seen.My only request, Mr. Matthes, is that you write the same book but for R. I've waded through a handful of R books to find the info you've so succinctly made available in Python Crash Course.

  Seriously, buy this book.  My programming experience prior was limited to a single semester class where all I learned was basic concepts without any actual language skills, and that was over a decade ago.  Less than halfway through this excellent text, and I was already starting the command line game project I had in mind.  Honestly, I was skeptical before and probably wouldn't have bought the book if it had not been discounted, but having seen how quickly I was grasping the concepts, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book at any price point.  There is a reason so many sources suggest this as a wonderful entry point to Python.tl:dr - Want to learn Python, Buy this book.

  I needed to learn basic Python for a specific project I had in mind. My previous ""code"" experience includes HTML/CSS and enough Javascript to dress up websites and make basic widgets to use at work. My hope with this book was to learn enough to get a barebones version of the project running then hand it off to a real programmer. I finished the first half of the book, which is the basics, and decided to try out a couple ideas before moving on to the ""example projects"" part of the book. The examples are great but some were honestly overkill for what I needed. To my surprise I had a working program in a few days. I recommend this book for anyone starting out with Python.

  As a developer in other languages, this book was a little too beginner for me, it spends chapters going over basic data types, arrays (lists), things that anyone would already know if they've wrote code in other languages.  I don't mean to imply the book is bad, I imagine if I had no experience this is a great way to get into it, but I was disappointed when I read the introduction and it mentioned the target audience was a widespread target of people with no coding experience to college course students; reading that I knew and confirmed after some reading that it was going to have some painfully basic parts.

  For a start, the cover falls off. That seems to have happened to other readers.  At least it makes it easier to keep the book open at the page you are reading while using your other two hands on the computer keyboard. The instructions on how to complete the installation of Python and Sublime Text so they would work together was not clear enough for me – I had to get help before I could make anything work. But then, progress through the chapters seems slow, especially if you are going to do all the exercises: The explanations are clear enough but I kept on wanting to look ahead to find out how to do something the book hadn't got to yet, and this is where I found the most frustrating inadequacy: the index is not helpful enough. If you want to find out how to copy a list to a file, for example, you won't find  any reference to that in the index.  Searching the internet is much more productive. Perhaps I was looking for a reference book rather than  ""crash course"". I needed the book but it didn't work as a crash course for me. It might for somebody with more patience.

  I am a total beginner to programming. In my quest to learn Python, I tried parts of some video courses, and even the Head First Python book. They were all good, HFP being the best of the group. But this book, in my opinion, is perfect. This is a lifelong programmer taking you through a perfectly logical learning course, laying a foundation from which to build upon. Just go through it slowly and methodically, type everything in the book along the way and ponder it, and I have no doubt you will learn this language and use it capably.The other thing I love is that he never goes more than a few pages without pausing for exercises, and the exercises are never too difficult. It's exactly what was just discussed, and the solutions are on his website if you need them (I rarely did bc of how well the material was presented).I emphatically recommend this. For me, it's the beginner's master text and I'm so glad I found this author.

I will say I found out though even though he book is meant for beginners and I am just a noob, I had some issues with sublime and found that using Anaconda much easier.

  I am an IT student with no prior knowledge of coding and just finished my first class. It was a struggle and I decided to spend the summer getting better before the next coding course start in the fall. The book covers a great deal but if you are a beginner the author does a great job of not just teaching how to code but also explains what is going on behind the scenes.The first half of the book covers basic topics and the second half consists of three projects that delve deeper into the world of python.I burned through this book in less than a week and plan on checking out as much as I can (Automate the boring stuff is next on my list) by this author over the summer.

  ## Allow me to preface by saying I’m only 5 chapters in and will update my review if need be if my opinion changes.Going into this I have tried learning python through other books and online courses but always struggled keeping everything straight and understanding how the code actually worked. Sometimes I feel that Python is so easy to write it’s hard to understand exactly what you’re even doing if you have no other language experience. So I actually spent a few months learning Java to understand the basics since Java sort of holds your hand in how you have to write so much more out like declaring every variable. I picked up this book to try and get back into Python and so far I’m LOVING this book. The author does a great job explaining what you need to know and nothing more. Straight to the point while still explaining each like of code very clearly. I’m excited to get to work on the project(s) later on in the book. If I still like it I will most likely order the publishers other Python book about “automating the boring stuff”.

  Edition 2 is cleaned up and better organized and focuses on Python 3 only (no reason to learn Python 2 anymore.)  While it uses Python to teach you to code it also teaches clean programming skills that apply to most other languages.The book is neatly broken down into two parts.  The first half focuses on installing and using the Python language.  It teaches using data, whiles, ifs, loops, accepting user input for interactivity – all the basic programming stuff.The second part features three projects: a video game (like Space Invaders), data visualization techniques to make graphs and charts, and an interactive web application.The book lists other online resources and has a well thought out Table of Contents and Index.  Appendix A covers installation issues and troubleshooting on various platforms.  Appendix B covers Text Editors including more on the recommended Sublime Text editor and Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Appendix C gives resources and ideas to take your coding beyond the book. The final Appendix shows how to use Git for version control in your programming.It’s a great resource and not a surprise that so many copies have sold.  Recommended.

  Of all of the things I've used to learn Python over the past 2 years, this book was the absolute worst. I think it's popular because it gives people a false sense that they understand the material, but all it does is set you up for failure when you try and do something that is slightly different from one of the examples in the book. As an example of what I mean, the book spends pages talking about how to create a list of favorite pizza toppings (something that should really take a couple of lines of explanation), and then there is an exercise to create a list of your favorite places in the world. Now if you know no Python, and I say this is a list of pizza toppings in Python, I would argue that you could probably give me a list of favorite cities in Python without ever having the slightest idea of what a Python list is. Pepperoni....let's replace that with Denver.........Meatballs.....you're now New York. It would be one thing if this was just the introductory exercise on lists and the exercises then progress to get more difficult. But this is literally true of every exercise in the entire book.

  This book came recommended in several searches on ""Best Python Book for EXPERIENCED programmers"". Simply put, while this book appears quite well written for complete novices who have never programmed in another language before, it's absolutely not suitable for experienced programmers who seek to learn Python.I came expecting the first chapter to give me some clarity on the pros and cons of Anaconda vs. direct install of Python, which libraries were most essential, and advice on which of the several Python IDEs might best suit my circumstances. Instead I found a long section introducing the concept of what a text editor is, and an entire chapter introducing the concept of what a variable is.I gave it 4 stars because the problem was with the advice I received, not with the author, who seems to have done an excellent job of writing a book for people with zero programming experience. For anyone else who shares my objectives, further research revealed that FLUENT PYTHON is probably the best book for those who have prior programming experience in other languages.

  Let me say that I have tried my hands at programming many times. I started with C, C++, Java, etc. years ago. Most books were dry and provided so many details that would overwhelm an average beginner like me. I would quit after spending time as I would lose confidence and had to move on with other life problems that came along. I didn't see myself spending more time, as I knew I would fail to complete.Not this book, however. Eric explains each concept in a simple, easy to understand manner. Through his examples, he keeps readers aware of how and where they can apply to the concept just learned, and his Try it Yourself exercise goes an extra step in solidifying the concepts.Programming is hard, but one can learn and master, I feel,  if you have a teacher like Eric, or read this book.Eric, a big thank you!

I started from the beginning and I'm almost to Dictionaries and I'm doing pretty well with it.The pacing is perfect for me and I love how things are explained. I think there was one time when something wasn't clear, but maybe I'm just dense.I see some people have had problems with the quality of the book. Mine has been in my backpack and hauled out in cafes several times and flipped through on a bookstand quite a bit.

The books is so clear in explaining the subjects at hand that makes me wondering how much effort and patient the author has put in writing the book. After explaining the basics in the first few chapters, more advanced topics such as Classes, Inheritance and Files are explained. The second half of the book covers 3 projects.

Small programs make it easy to follow the concepts and the exercises build on the concepts. Great book to have as a reference on your bookshelf.

  A growing trend affecting books purchased from Amazon is the fact they are 'Print On Demand' and are very poor quality.Within a week of purchasing and about 120 pages read, the cover detached itself from the body... Totally unacceptable! This is one of several books that I have purchased from Amazon over the last couple of years that has suffered from some sort of printing/binding issue. Problems range from splines plitting, covers detaching or delaminating, covers also suffer with excess curl...I have many books that are 20 to 30 years old that are in better condition that ones that are virtually new by comparison... It's not difficult to make books well, we've been doing it for hundreds of years!The content of the book seems well written so far and is suitable for beginners of the Python language and also for more experienced programmers that come from different programming backgrounds...I will think twice now before ordering books from Amazon now and try to find alternatives that have been printed and bound in a professional way that should last a lifetime!

  Python is a pretty easy language to get going with and this book 'holds your hand' very well.As you work through the 'try it yourself' sections you will find yourself thinking ""I've already done this before"" but that's ok because it's just reinforcing your understanding, by the end of chapter 4 you'll be creating your own 'lists' of data in their millions, slicing them up, pulling individual elements out, cycling through your lists using 'for' loops, formatting your output using 'F' strings etc etc, and you'll be able to code these things without opening the book as a reference!

  I've mainly purchased this book to have a good source in details but it's more suitable for beginners. I haven't experienced any problems about the print quality, unlike other comments I'm very happy that there isn't any coloured text or black background code snippets. I found more beneficial to take your own notes or highlight manually the parts you had practised. It's easier to look back and find your notes on the book. Otherwise it's not different than reading people's snippets on stackoverflow.  Paper quality is good. Nothing to complain but I wish I had chance have a sneak peek to know the level of information. If you just started to learn python this book is great for you. But if you already finished a beginner python course or watch CS50 week 6 on YouTube, you don't need this book for learning. But you can benefit the projects part. I also purchased O'Reilly python cookbook from Amazon and if you need advanced information to solve complex problems you should check them too.

  This could be used by a complete beginner to coding, in which case it's worth working carefully through all the examples.  It holds your hand as you work through the basics.  It then moves on to projects, data visualisation, and web applications.  If you have some programming experience you might feel able to skip bits.  You will really want to use a text editor like Sublime.  Theoretically this is is free but constant reminders will drive you nuts so you will end up spending £50 buying it (but it IS excellent).You will need a Pritt Stick as the binding keeps coming off, but I can live with that.  In any case you would not want to invest in a fancy hard back binding for a book that in the nature of things will become obsolete in three to four years.

  A huuuuuuge compliment to the author of this book! I have never seen such a great book when it comes to teaching programming languages. It starts with simple things like printing something onto the screen, then tells you about variables, comparisons, lists, for-loops, conditions and so on, always building up on the simple things. Each and every concept is shown in small programm snippets that are first shown as programm listing, then explained in detail, and then the output is shown. What I REALLY like about the didactics in this book is that the author also shows common errors when using the commands/methods he just showed us, how to spot those errors, how to provoke them to understand what is going on and how to correct them. He also now and then encourages the reader to think about projects he might want to do later on. I downloaded a Python editor onto my cellphone and test things as I read them. It's real fun to learn Python this way!

  The contents are organized into two parts: Part one goes through the language constructs, functions, classes, etc.; while part two walks one through three very different projects. If you're already familiar with object oriented programming and want to learn a new language, python in this case, then you may find this book somewhat verbose. But that just means you can skim over some or more of the text per your level of familiarity. I decided to spend some time on the last of the three projects, Web Applications: This one uses the Django framework, which is great in that you can make a professional looking site fairly easily; but it is also a bit distracting in that there's less about the python language in this project and more about the Django framework constructs. Anyhow, that's likely a subjective view. All-in-all, it is a very nice book to learn the python language, and use it a few different ways.

  I've been doing some work with Python, but wanted to make sure I fully understand the basics and things one can do with Python aside from data analysis.I recommend this book for people who have never used Python before, as this book covers basics such as lists, dictionaries, if statemens, loops etc.What I particularly like is how the code is broken down each time and the author is good at explaining what it does.Some may find parts irrelevant to what they want to do with Python, as this book takes many examples from computer games and online services. Also, from my experience, there won't be any literature out there where you will find everything working first time. Some code from this book had me troubling a little, but much less than most sources.You won't be a master of Python after this book, but you will have solid basics.The reason I gave 4 stars is because the binding or glueing of this book is terrible and the bookshell broke off after a few days, as other people have mentioned here.Great book!

  This is an absolute must  read for complete beginners, it assumes reader has no programming background and would teach everything from the basics. The best part is that there are three projects that would help you cement whatever one learns in the chapters. Easy to read with  proper explanation of technical Jargon.This book would clear your basics for sure and prepare you for reading about more advanced topics and applications using Python.

  I am fairly new to Python and am  about 30 % through this book.  This first part of the book deals almost entirely with the programming language.  Lots of examples of code are given and exercises to do throughout each chapter.  By and large, I am able to follow along with most of it, with a few bumps along the road when new concepts are introduced.  I haven't read in this book much about the way Python deals with files on the computer and the online code resources that are available, so am hoping that the book discusses these in subsequent chapters.  May get back to update this review later.  This book seems suitable for a older teen/adult.

  Les premiers chapitres sont vraiment ce qu'on attend d'une bonne initiation à un langage... puis ça se gâte un peu. L'auteur passe trop tôt à des exemples élaborés et souvent obscurs, égrenant en cours de route des explications et des éclaircissements qu'on aurait bien préféré trouver dans des chapitres spécifiques – notamment sur l'identification et la compréhension des librairies et des modules spécifiques à diverses utilisations.

  C'est un excellent ouvrage pour qui veut découvrir la programmation en Python, voire la programmation tout court. L'anglais utilisé est très accessible et le style agréable. On est mis dans le bain très vite mais tous les détails sont minutieusement expliqués Ces explications pourront parfois sembler longuettes au lecteur, mais il peut aisément choisir de les passer. En revanche il est clair que quelqu'un qui a un niveau intermédiaire (ou ""pis"", confirmé) en Python n'en tirera que peu de bénéfices.Une fois les chapitres d'introduction générale passés, on met le pied à l'étrier à travers plusieurs projets très intéressants et instructifs pour le néophyte, au menu : un petit shoot'em up basique, des travaux d'exploitation de données scientifiques collectées en ligne avec des outils graphiques, conception d'un site web avec Django... Chaque projet peut être réalisé indépendamment des autres.J'avais des bases très élémentaires avant de suivre ce livre, il m'a permis de les consolider très plaisamment. je ne regrette pas mes euros investis.

  En même temps que les principes de base du Python sont expliqués, l'auteur entre trop dans les détails au lieu d'y revenir plus tard. Par exemple pour le chapitre sur comment utiliser les listes, il va passer du temps pour expliquer le résultat en indentant le code dans la boucle, avant la boucle, après la boucle, pleins de fonctionalités sur les listes, on s'y perd sans même avoir encore abordé les conditions du chapitre suivant.J'ai été découragé à lire la suite, j'aurais préféré une explication des bases, réaliser tôt des projets et des explications plus avancées dans les pages suivantes. Ce livre à une bonne réputation non mérité, on trouve de meilleurs tutoriels d'initiation à Python sur YouTube et les tutoriels sur le moteur de jeu Godot en GDScript (basé sur Python) permettent d'en apprendre beaucoup tout en faisant des jeux vidéo.

  This is really the book to read if you are starting programming, not only python. The code is clearly written and explained.The first chapter covers the basics for python programming, and the second chapter the author introduces three projects that put python usage in perspective.I really recommend this book for all the new comers to the programming world.
